Or, a chatbot could use reflection to learn from its interactions with users and improve its responses over time. However, reflection also has its limitations. It can be computationally expensive and may not always lead to the desired outcome.  Overall, reflection is a promising technique for building more intelligent and adaptable AI systems, but it is important to carefully consider its potential benefits and limitations.', 'search_queries': ['reflection in AI advantages', 'reflection in AI disadvantages', 'reflection in AI applications']}, 'id': '53b1a93d-9857-404b-bf20-46eecb69535a'}])"

The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.[37]\\\\nIn the DEPS (\\\\\"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\\\\\") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.[38]\\\\nThe Reflexion method[39] constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. One broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\\\\\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\\\\\", \\\\\"No\\\\\").[85] A question answering task is considered \\\\\"open book\\\\\" if the model\\'s prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \\\\\"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\\\\\"[85]). The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.[70]\\\\nLet\\\\nx\\\\n{\\\\\\\\displaystyle x}\\\\nbe the number of parameter count, and\\\\ny\\\\n{\\\\\\\\displaystyle y}\\\\nbe the performance of the model.\\\\n\"}, {\"url\": \"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/\", \"content\": \"The size of the model is generally determined by an empirical relationship between the model size, the number of parameters, and the size of the training data.\\\\n Here are some thoughts on the future of LLMs,\\\\nIncreased capabilities\\\\nAs impressive as they are, the current level of technology is not perfect and LLMs are not infallible.

Convertible Loan Agreement (CLA) is one specific and widely used type of convertible debt:\\\\n\\\\u200d\\\\n- A CLA is similar to SAFE, where an investor loans money to a startup with the agreement that the loan will convert into equity at a later date, usually during a future funding round.\\\\u200d\\\\n- CLAs often include an interest rate and a conversion discount, which incentivizes investors to provide funding while offering them a potential discount on the future equity price.\\\\u200d\\\\nOther types of debt include, for instance, OCA (Obligations Convertibles en Actions), which are convertible bonds adopted in France.\\\\n Our Offices\\\\nGermany\\\\n\\\\u200dNeue Sch\\\\u00f6nhauser Stra\\\\u00dfe 13\\\\n\\\\u200d10178 Berlin\\\\nNetherlands\\\\nHerengracht 71HS\\\\n1015BD Amsterdam\\\\nFor Founders\\\\nFor Investors\\\\nFor Fund Managers\\\\nResources\\\\nAbout us\\\\n\\\\u00a9 2024 bunch technology Subsequently, a year later, she transitioned to the role of Expansion Lead, where she now drives bunch\\'s growth and supports the company\\'s vision of becoming a pan-European platform for private market investing.\\\\n\"}], [{\"url\": \"https://plannit.ai/\", \"content\": \"For Free\\\\nFunding Ready Business Plan\\\\nExecutive Summary\\\\nOverview\\\\nCompany Overview\\\\nProblem Statement\\\\nBusiness Description\\\\nMission Statement\\\\nBusiness Model\\\\nProducts and Services\\\\nAdditional Features\\\\nRevenue Model\\\\nMarket Analysis\\\\nTarget Market\\\\nMarket Size and Segments\\\\nUnique Value Proposition\\\\nRisks and Mitigations\\\\nIdentified Risks\\\\nMitigation Strategies\\\\nFinancials\\\\nFinancial Overview\\\\nIncome Statement\\\\nExecution\\\\nMarketing and Sales Plan\\\\nLeadership\\\\nFocus On Your Vision\\\\nKey Features & Benefits\\\\nModify and regenerate sections of your business plan using premade or custom prompts.

Because of the massive uncertainty that surrounds macroeconomic estimates of future climate change impacts, strategies to build the resilience of the economy, especially through appropriate diversification of the economic structure, export composition and tax base, are particularly attractive over the short term.\\n Yet, the global economic ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of climate change are forcing the country to confront new challenges: shocks not only threaten further progress but can reverse hard won successes of the past.\\n And they will also need to provide direct support to the poorest people, who cannot afford to invest in adaptation but are the most vulnerable to experiencing devastating effects of climate change.\\n\"}, {\"url\": \"https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/what-climate-change-adaptation-and-why-it-crucial\", \"content\": \"Countries agreed to global time-bound targets around specific themes and sectors \\u2013 for example in areas such as water and sanitation, food and agriculture, and poverty eradication and livelihoods \\u2013 as well as under what\\u2019s called the \\u201cadaptation cycle,\\u201d a global framework guiding countries on the steps necessary to plan for and implement adaptation.\\n In addition to developing the policies needed to guide adaptation, governments need to look at large-scale measures such as strengthening or relocating infrastructure from coastal areas affected by sea-level rise, building infrastructure able to withstand more extreme weather conditions, enhancing early warning systems and access to disaster information, developing insurance mechanisms specific to climate-related threats, and creating new protections for wildlife and natural ecosystems.\\n The urgency is especially great for developing countries, which are already feeling the impacts of climate change and are particularly vulnerable due to a combination of factors, including their geographical and climatic conditions, their high dependence on natural resources, and their limited capacity to adapt to a changing climate. Other countries such as Malawi and Pakistan are modernizing the capture and use of climate data and early warning systems, equipping communities, farmers and policy makers with the information they need to protect lives and livelihoods.\\n With every fraction of a degree of warming, the impacts of climate change will become more frequent and more intense \\u2013 and adaptation will become that much harder and more expensive for people and ecosystems.\\n\"}]]\n",
